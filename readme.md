## Signal Processing Course Implementation

### Overview
This C++ implementation is based on the Signal Processing course taught by Dr. Markus Kuhn. The course covers fundamental signal-processing principles, digital communications examples, and practical programming assignments.

For full course details, lectures, and implementation instructions, see the course-specific documentation:

[Signal Processing Full Documentation](./DSP/readme.md)

## Modern Cryptography Course Implementation

### Overview
This C++ implementation is based on the Modern Cryptography course. It introduces both theoretical and practical aspects of cryptographic standards, algorithms, and secure system design.

For full course details, lectures, and implementation instructions, see the course-specific documentation:

[Modern Cryptography Full Documentation](./End/readme.md)
