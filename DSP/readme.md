3. **Fourier Transform**: Phasors as orthogonal base functions, forms of the Fourier transform, convolution theorem, Dirac's delta function, impulse combs in time and frequency domains.
4. **Discrete Sequences and Spectra**: Periodic sampling of continuous signals, periodic signals, aliasing, sampling and reconstruction of low-pass and band-pass signals, spectral inversion.
5. **Discrete Fourier Transform**: Continuous vs. discrete Fourier transform, symmetry, linearity, review of FFT, real-valued FFT.
6. **Spectral Estimation**: Leakage and scalloping phenomena, windowing, zero padding.
7. **Finite and Infinite Impulse-Response Filters**: Properties of filters, implementation forms, window-based FIR design, frequency-inversion, modulation, FFT-based convolution, polynomial representation, z-transform, zeros and poles.
8. **Digital Modulation**: IQ representation of band-pass signals, AM, FM, MSK, QAM, and OFDM signals, clock recovery, symbol detection, matched filter, software-defined radio.
9. **Random Sequences and Noise**: Random variables, stationary processes, autocorrelation, crosscorrelation, filtered random sequences, white noise, exponential averaging.
10. **Correlation Coding**: Random vectors, dependence vs. correlation, covariance, decorrelation, matrix diagonalization, eigen decomposition, Karhunen-Lo√®ve transform, principal component analysis.
11. **Lossy vs. Lossless Compression**: Perceptual scales, masking, spatial resolution, color coordinates, demonstration experiments.
